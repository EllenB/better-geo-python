# Description

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

The aim of this repository is to enhance my skills in Python from starting to a more efficient set-up of the working (Python) environment, the use of several tools (Docker, Django, etc), learning some postgis database and use tools for better Python coding (linting, formatting, etc). 

Examples will be drawn from the geospatial domain.
